            Face recognition in the wild is now advancing towards light-weight models, fast inference speed and
            resolution-adapted capability. In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex
            face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face
            recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved
            via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior
            knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and
            discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further
            transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning. By learning
            low-resolution face representations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a light-weight
            student model can be constructed with high efficiency and promising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution
            faces. Experimental results show that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution
            faces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory. Meanwhile, its speed reaches up to 14,705, 934 and 763
            faces per second on GPU, CPU and mobile phone, respectively.</p>

            In spite of great success in many image recognition tasks achieved by recent deep models, directly applying
            them to recognize low-resolution images may suffer from low accuracy due to the missing of informative
            details during resolution degradation. However, these images are still recognizable for subjects who are
            familiar with the corresponding high-resolution ones. Inspired by that, we propose a teacher-student
            learning approach to facilitate low-resolution image recognition via hybrid order relational knowledge
            distillation. The approach refers to three streams: the teacher stream is pretrained to recognize
            high-resolution images in high accuracy, the student stream is learned to identify low-resolution images by
            mimicking the teacher's behaviors, and the extra assistant stream is introduced as bridge to help knowledge
            transfer across the teacher to the student. To extract sufficient knowledge for reducing the loss in
            accuracy, the learning of student is supervised with multiple losses, which preserves the similarities in
            various order relational structures. In this way, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar
            low-resolution images can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive
            experiments on metric learning, low-resolution image classification and low-resolution face recognition
            tasks show the effectiveness of our approach, while taking reduced models.</p>

            Typically, the deployment of face recognition models in the wild needs to identify low-resolution faces with
            extremely low computational cost. To address this problem, a feasible solution is compressing a complex face
            model to achieve higher speed and lower memory at the cost of minimal performance drop. Inspired by that,
            this paper proposes a learning approach to recognize low-resolution faces via selective knowledge
            distillation. In this approach, a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) is first initialized to
            recognize high-resolution faces and resolution-degraded faces with a teacher stream and a student stream,
            respectively. The teacher stream is represented by a complex CNN for high-accuracy recognition, and the
            student stream is represented by a much simpler CNN for low-complexity recognition. To avoid significant
            performance drop at the student stream, we then selectively distil the most informative facial features from
            the teacher stream by solving a sparse graph optimization problem, which are then used to regularize the
            fine-tuning process of the student stream. In this way, the student stream is actually trained by
            simultaneously handling two tasks with limited computational resources: approximating the most informative
            facial cues via feature regression, and recovering the missing facial cues via low-resolution face
            classification. Experimental results show that the student stream performs impressively in recognizing
            low-resolution faces and costs only 0.15-MB memory and runs at 418 faces per second on CPU and 9433 faces
            per second on GPU.</p>

            Low-resolution face recognition in the wild still is an open problem. In this paper, we propose to address
            this problem via a novel learning approach called Mixed-Domain Distillation (MDD). The approach applies a
            teacher-student framework to mix and distill knowledge from four different domain datasets, including
            private high-resolution, public high-resolution, public low-resolution web and target lowresolution wild
            face datasets. In this way, high-resolution knowledge from the well-trained complex teacher model is first
            adapted to public high-resolution faces and then transferred to a simply student model. The student model is
            designed to identify low-resolution faces, and could perform face recognition in the wild effectively and
            efficiently. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing models for
            low-resolution face recognition in the wild.

            Is it possible to train an effective face recognition model with fewer shots that works efficiently on
            low-resolution faces in the wild? To answer this question, this paper proposes a few-shot knowledge
            distillation approach to learn an ultrafast face recognizer via two steps. In the first step, we initialize
            a simple yet effective face recognition model on synthetic low-resolution faces by distilling knowledge from
            an existing complex model. By removing the redundancies in both face images and the model structure, the
            initial model can provide an ultrafast speed with impressive recognition accuracy. To further adapt this
            model into the wild scenarios with fewer faces per person, the second step refines the model via few-shot
            learning by incorporating a relation module that compares low-resolution query faces with faces in the
            support set. In this manner, the performance of the model can be further enhanced with only fewer
            low-resolution faces in the wild. Experimental results show that the proposed approach performs favorably
            against state-of-the-arts in recognizing low-resolution faces with an extremely low memory of 30KB and runs
            at an ultrafast speed of 1,460 faces per second on CPU or 21,598 faces per second on GPU.
